			A simple shell for kernel debugging.

================================================================================

= Introduction

A simple shell for kernel debugging, compiles WITHOUT any dependency including
libc and libgcc/compiler-rt)

= Supported Architectures

 o x86_64/amd64
 o aarch64/arm64
 o riscv64

= Build

You need

 o ISO C99-compatible C Compiler
 o make

The makefile assumes C compiler CC is able to handle assembly (.S files), too.

== Makefile Arguments

 o ARCH:	Targeted Architecture
 o CC:		Compiler Name
 o CROSS_COMPILE:
 		The prefix of cross toolchain
 o RELEASE:	When RELEASE is set to 1, kdsh is compiled with optimization and
 		without debug symbols.

== Native Build

For a native build, simply run

	make

The architecture is detected by 'uname -m'

== Cross Compiling

For cross compiling, you need to specify ARCH, CROSS_COMPILE manually.

e.g., to build on arm64 with gcc prefixed aarch64-none-elf-
(aarch64-none-elf-gcc), the following command is appropriate.

	make ARCH=aarch64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-elf-

== Generate initramfs

The makefile could generate an initramfs with kdsh only, but

 o cpio
 o gzip

is needed.

	make initramfs
